The code to do this is as follows.\n\n```{r message=FALSE, }\nnoSim = 10000\nn <- 40\nlambda <- 0.2\n\nset.seed(1)\nsimulations <- data.frame(x=replicate(noSim, mean(rexp(n, lambda))))\n\nmean <- mean(simulations$x)\nstdError <- sd(simulations$x)\nexpectedMean <- 1 / lambda\nexpectedStdError <- 1 / lambda / sqrt(n)\n```\n\n## Show where the distribution is centered at and compare it to the theoretical center of the distribution.\nThe expected center of the distribution (population mean) is `r sprintf(\"%.3f\", expectedMean)` vs an actual mean for the simulations of `r sprintf(\"%.3f\", mean)`.  \n\n## Show how variable it is and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution\nThe expected variance of the distributions population is `r sprintf(\"%.3f\", expectedStdError^2)` vs an actual variance for the simulations of `r sprintf(\"%.3f\", stdError^2)`.\n\n## Show that the distribution is approximately normal\n\nThe result of these simulations are summarised in the graph below.  As can be seen the simulations appears to be approximately normally distributed :\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nrequire(ggplot2)\n\ng <- ggplot(simulations, aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=.3, colour = \"black\", fill = \"lightblue\", aes(y = ..density..)) \ng <- g + stat_function(fun = dnorm, arg=list(mean=expectedMean, sd=expectedStdError), size = 2, aes(colour = \"darkblue\"))\ng <- g + scale_colour_manual(name=\"Legend\", values=c(\"darkblue\"), labels=c(parse(text=\"plain('    Normal Distribution ')*(mu==5)*plain(', ')*(sigma==5)\")))\ng <- g + theme(legend.position=\"bottom\")\nprint(g)\n```\n\n## Evaluate the coverage of the confidence interval for 1/lambda: X¯±1.96Sn√.\n\nThe confidence interval of X +/- 1.96 S / sqrt(n) for the simulation of the exponential distibution with n=40 and lambda=0.2 is (`r sprintf(\"%.3f\", mean-1.96*stdError)`, `r sprintf(\"%.3f\", mean+1.96*stdError)`).  By definition `r sprintf(\"%.2f%%\", 100*(pnorm(1.96)-pnorm(-1.96)))` of the means would be expected to fall within this range. In the simulation `r sprintf(\"%.2f%%\", 100.0*(sum(simulations$x>mean-1.96*stdError & simulations$x<mean+1.96*stdError)/noSim))` did.\n",
